    "A reference frame is how we measure space.  It can be thought of as a rigid structure, and, in fact, every rigid body is equivalent to a reference frame (much more on this much later). Because we are trying to span the $\\mb R^3$ vector space, we need three basis elements. We won't go into the proof of this here, but take it as a postulate. Multiple proofs of this assertion are possible, but require setting up some additional mathematical machinery that we won't really need. The three basis elements are linearly independent unit vectors, which makes them mutually orthogonal.  We'll get to an exact definition of orthogonality in a little bit, but conceptually, this means that each of the unit vectors defining the reference frame is rotated exactly 90 degrees from the other two, as in the <a href=\"#fig:refframe\" >figure</a> above. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Components\n",
    "Let's recall the utility of a basis set: it allows us to encode all elements of a vector space as weighted sums of elements of the basis, and this is exactly what a reference frame does for us.  By defining a reference frame, we can write any geometric vector as a sum of its **components**. So, as in the <a href=\"#fig:refframe\" >figure</a>, once you have defined a reference frame $\\mc I$ with mutually orthogonal unit directions $\\bhat e_1, \\bhat e_2, \\bhat e_3$, the position of point $P$ with respect to point $O$ can be expressed as the weighted sum:\n",
    "$$\\mf r_{P/O} = x_1 \\bhat{e}_1 +  x_2 \\bhat{e}_2 + x_3 \\bhat{e}_3$$\n",
    "The component weights ($x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$) are sometimes referred to as the **measure numbers** of the vector in the particular reference frame being used. \n",
    "\n",
    "At some point in your life, someone may have told you that a geometric vector was a list (or array) of three scalar values.  That person was lying to you.  You should find them, and make them ashamed.  The array of three scalars represents the components of a vector in a particular reference frames.  Euclidean vectors by themselves are purely geometric objects - they exist and are fully defined in the absence of any reference frame definition.  However, once we have defined a reference frame, it is frequently convenient to express our vectors in its components.  When we do this, we must be careful to never lose sight of which frame (or frames) we're working with.  One notational solution would be to always write out the full summation including the unit vectors, as in the equation above, but this is cumbersome.  Instead, we'll introduce a new notational convention to help us along. For any vector $\\mf r$, we will denote its components in a frame $\\mc I$ as $\\left[\\mf r \\right]_\\mc I$.  The square brackets remind us that the component representation is a list of scalars, which we choose (for reasons that will become clearer momentarily) to describe as an array.  The right subscript reminds us of the frame these components belong to.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with this new notation, the previous equation becomes:\n",
    "$$\\left[\\mf r_{P/O} \\right]_\\mc I = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix}_\\mc I$$\n",
    "Notice two things: first, there is an implicit order of the frame unit vectors (such that the component $x_1$ corresponds to direction $\\bhat{e}_1$, etc.).  This means that it is crucial to state your frame unit vector order when you define it.  In this case, we can state that $\\mc I= \\left(\\bhat{e}_1, \\bhat{e}_2, \\bhat{e}_3\\right)$. Second, note that we have written the component array as a column matrix (as opposed to a row matrix). Our convention will be to *always* express component arrays as column matrices (again, there's a specific reason for this that will be revealed in a little bit). "

Notice how this exercise had the components of the vector be functions of multiple variables, i.e. $a+c$, $b+c$, etc.? That was actually a sneaky way of getting us into a discussion on coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have learned at some point in your life, that **coordinate systems** and reference frames were the same thing.  Once again, this is entirely and utterly wrong (you know what to do).  There is a crucial distinction between these two concepts.  Reference frames are basis sets for geometric vectors. The components of a vector in a particular reference frame can be written as *functions* of **coordinates**. Coordinates are therefore scalar quantities that allow us to parametrize how we measure the systems we are analyzing. In **analytical mechanics** (which is just classical mechanics, but fancier), we use **generalized coordinates**.  Generalized coordinates are just that - a complete generalization of the concept of coordinate systems.  We'll touch on this concept briefly here, and then come back to it much later.  Assume that we have a set of generalized coordinates, that we will call $q_1, q_2, q_3, \\ldots q_n$ (that is, we have $n$ distinct generalized coordinates).  Assume also that we have some position vector, $\\mf r$ that is relevant to the analysis of the system for which we defined these generalized coordinates.  Given these two assumptions, what we're really saying is that we can write the components of $\\mf r$ in some reference frame $\\mc I$ as:\n",
    "$$\\left[\\mf r_{P/O} \\right]_\\mc I = \\begin{bmatrix} f_1(q_1, q_2, q_3, \\ldots q_n) \\\\ f_2(q_1, q_2, q_3, \\ldots q_n) \\\\ f_3(q_1, q_2, q_3, \\ldots q_n) \\end{bmatrix}_\\mc I$$\n",
    "where $f_1, f_2$, and $f_3$ are functions or some or all of the generalized coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cartesian Coordinates\n",
    "Ok, that's all fine, but doesn't seem really helpful.  Let's nail down this concept by thinking about specific coordinate systems. The simplest option are the **Cartesian** coordinates (named in honor of René Descartes, who thought about himself a lot). These coordinates correspond 1:1 to the unit vectors of your reference frame.  When we write:\n",
    "$$\\left[\\mf r_{P/O} \\right]_\\mc I = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix}_\\mc I$$\n",
    "what we're really saying is that $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are Cartesian coordinates. If we go back to being super pedantic for just a second, the Cartesian coordinates represent the case where $f_1(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1$, $f_2(x_1, x_2, x_3) =  x_2$ and $f_3(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_3$.  Any time you have scalar values that are exactly equal to the measure numbers of components along each of the 3 unit vectors defining a reference frame, you are dealing with Cartesian coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce two more coordinate systems: **cylindrical** coordinates (often called **polar** coordinates when you are working in 2D) and **spherical** coordinates.\n",

    "## Polar/Cylindrical Coordinates\n",
    "Polar/Cylindrical coordinates are useful for tracking radial (circular or closed path) motion in a single plane.  The polar coordinates $\\rho, \\theta$ map to the Cartesian coordinates as $x = \\rho\\cos\\theta$ and $y = \\rho\\sin\\theta$. Thus, we can write:\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\theta$ is an **azimuth** angle: it measures the rotation of the position vector in the plane defined by the first two unit directions of our reference frame (i.e., the $\\bhat{e}_1-\\bhat{e}_2$ plane).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spherical Coordinates\n",
    "The spherical coordinates $(r,\\theta,\\phi)$ allow us to write the components of our position vector as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, $\\phi$ is the **zenith** or **polar** angle.  Zenith is the direction directly above a given location (and nadir is the point below).  The complement to the zenith angle (i.e., $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\phi$) is known as the **elevation** angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we have made a distinction between the polar coordinate radius ($\\rho$) and spherical coordinate radius $r$.  These are two very different quantities.  The spherical radius $r$ is the magnitude of the position vector.  The polar radius $\\rho$, on the other hand, is the **projection** of the spherical radius onto the $\\bhat{e}_1-\\bhat{e}_2$ plane.  We're not quite ready to formally define projection, but we will, in just a little bit. The intuitive understanding of projection can be seen in the <a href=\"#fig:cylsphercoords\" >figure</a>, above: if we split $\\mf r_{P/O}$ into two vectors, one of which lies in the $\\bhat{e}_1-\\bhat{e}_2$ plane and one of which is orthogonal to that plane, then $r$ will be the magnitude of the vector that's in the $\\bhat{e}_1-\\bhat{e}_2$ plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "Here's a thing: mathematicians and physicists suck.  We fundamentally cannot agree on a single, universal, spherical coordinate definition.  So, you will find some references using $\\theta$ as an azimuth angle and some using $\\phi$ as an azimuth. Some references will define spherical coordinates as we have here, using an azimuth and zenith angle, while others will use an azimuth and an elevation.  If you think this is all needlessly confusing, you are 100% correct. For the remainder of this text, whenever we talk about spherical coordinates in general, we will be assuming the definition given above.  However, occasionally we will bring up specific, named, spherical coordinate systems, and many of these will use elevation angles.  Whenever this happens, we will make a specific note of it.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "An incredibly important thing has happened here (did you spot it?).  We have written the components of the same vector ($\\mf r_{P/O}$) in the same reference frame ($\\mc I$) in three completely different ways.  The key takeaway is that every reference frame can have an *infinite* number of coordinate systems associated with them.  Remember: reference frames tell us how to decompose space into three directions.  Coordinate systems tell us how to go about evaluating the components of a vector in a particular reference frames.  They work together, but serve different functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because these concepts are so closely linked, it is actually useful to expand our reference frame nomenclature slightly, and, when defining a reference frame, to also include a coordinate system origin.  Note that there is absolutely no requirement to do so - a reference frame is fully defined without any coordinate system definitions, and consists solely of three unit vectors, but, in practice, we will almost always wish to associate coordinates with our reference frames, and these coordinates must be defined as being measured *from* somewhere - hence the coordinate system origin.  Notationally, we represent this by adding a point to our reference frame definition.  Thus, for the frame $\\mc I$ depicted in the <a href=\"#fig:cylsphercoords\" >figure</a>, we would write: $\\mc I = \\left(O, \\bhat{e}_1, \\bhat{e}_2, \\bhat{e}_3\\right)$, which tells us that the Cartesian coordinates associated with this frame all equal zero at point $O$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cartesian, Cylindrical, and Spherical coordinates are by no means the only standard coordinate systems available to us, but they are, by far, the most ubiquitous and the ones we will turn to most often.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Basis\n",
    "At this point, it is also worthwhile to consider the representation of the unit vectors defining a frame in components of *that same frame*.  Let's continue with our frame $\\mc I = \\left(O, \\bhat{e}_1, \\bhat{e}_2, \\bhat{e}_3\\right)$, and consider the components of the $\\bhat{e}_1$ unit vector, i.e., $\\left[\\bhat{e}_1 \\right]_{\\mc I}.$ We are looking for something with magnitude 1, that has a direction entirely in the first unit direction of the $\\mc I$ frame.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus,$\\left[\\bhat{e}_1 \\right]_{\\mc I} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}_\\mc I$  and similarly, $\\left[\\bhat{e}_2 \\right]_{\\mc I} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}_\\mc I$ and $\\left[\\bhat{e}_3 \\right]_{\\mc I} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}_\\mc I$\n",

    "Recall that our definition of vectors (as elements of a vector space) carried with it the definition of a vector addition operator and scalar multiplication operator, but no vector multiplication operator.  Part of the reason for this is that no such operator required for the vector space definition to work, but also, because there's not one unique operator (or even class of operators) that you can call vector multiplication.  There are at least three different types of operator that can all equivalently be termed vector multiplication, and each of them produces an entirely different *kind* of result.  We will now discuss each of these, in turn.\n",

    "## (Scalar) Dot Product\n",

    "The **dot product**, sometimes called a **scalar dot product** or **scalar product** is an operation on two vectors returning a scalar (i.e., $V \\times V \\rightarrow \\mc F$ for vector space $V$ defined over field $\\mc F$).  Formally, it is an **inner product** for the Euclidean vector space. Inner products are additional operators that can be defined for vector spaces (making them into inner product spaces) that are defined (much like vector addition) by their required properties.   Here, we will list the relevant properties of the scalar dot product of the Euclidean vector space defined over the field of real numbers, which are a subset of the full inner product definition. \n",

    "</ol>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product also gives us our first formal definition of orthogonality.  Two vectors $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$ are mutually orthogonal if and only if $\\mf a \\cdot \\mf b = 0$. 'If and only if' (iff) is one of the strongest statements you can make in mathematics. It defines a bi-directional relationship, such that each half of the statement requires the other.  That is to say, if you have two vectors whose dot product equals zero, then they are necessarily orthogonal to one another, and stating that two vectors are orthogonal equivalently means that their dot product is zero. \n",

    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"img/dot_product.png\" alt=\"Scalar Dot Product\" width=\"350\" id=\"fig:dotproduct\"/></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a purely geometric interpretation of the dot product, as illustrated in the <a href=\"#fig:dotproduct\" >figure</a>, above. Recall our visualization of Euclidean vectors as joining two points in space.  Recall also our previous discussion that any two vectors with the same magnitude and direction are effectively the same vector.  This means that we can always represent two vectors as being co-originating, as in the <a href=\"#fig:dotproduct\" >figure</a>.  That is to say, if we have a vector joining points $A$ and $B$, and another vector joining points $C$ and $D$, we can always draw them as two legs of a triangle, as in the <a href=\"#fig:dotproduct\" >figure</a>, so long as we preserve their magnitudes and directions.  From Euclidean geometry, we know that every triangle lies within a plane, and so we are always able to uniquely define an angle between our two vectors, which we shall call $\\theta$. Given all this, we can state another definition for the scalar dot product:\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "   $$\\mf a \\cdot \\mf b = \\Vert \\mf a \\Vert\\Vert \\mf b \\Vert \\cos\\theta$$\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the angle between the two vectors is 90 degrees, then the cosine and the overall dot product evaluate to zero.  In this way, orthogonality of Euclidean vectors is equivalent to the vectors being at a right angle to one another, as we posited earlier.  Yay! We have resolved one of our pending assumptions! Only about eleventy-billion left to go. We now have a working definition of the geometric relationship between the unit vectors forming our reference frames:  if $\\bhat{e}_1, \\bhat{e}_2, \\bhat{e}_3$ form a reference frame, then $\\bhat{e}_1 \\cdot \\bhat{e}_2 = 0$, $\\bhat{e}_1 \\cdot \\bhat{e}_3 = 0$ and $\\bhat{e}_2 \\cdot \\bhat{e}_3 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometric interpretation of the dot product also nails down the concept of **projection**. The point of a reference frame is that it allows us to decompose any vector into components that measure the parts of the vector that extend in the directions of each of the three unit vectors making up the frame.  If a vector's direction is, for example, entirely in $\\bhat{e}_1$, then we would expect that this vector has a non-zero $\\bhat{e}_1$ component (with a measure number equal to the vector's magnitude) and zero components in the $\\bhat{e}_2$ and $\\bhat{e}_3$ directions.  Alternatively, if a vector lies entirely in the $\\bhat{e}_2 - \\bhat{e}_3$ plane, then we would expect the $\\bhat{e}_2$ and $\\bhat{e}_3$ components to be non-zero, and the $\\bhat{e}_1$ component to be zero.  The process of extracting the component of a vector that lies in a particular direction is the process of projection.  Mathematically, what we are doing when we calculate the components of a vector in the various directions of a reference frame is computing the dot product of the vector with each of those directions.  That is, the $\\bhat{e}_1$ component of a vector $\\mf r$ is $(\\mf r \\cdot \\bhat{e}_1) \\bhat{e}_1$.  More generally, we can write:\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "   $$\\left[\\mf r \\right]_\\mc I = \\begin{bmatrix}\\mf r \\cdot \\bhat{e}_1 \\\\ \\mf r \\cdot \\bhat{e}_2 \\\\ \\mf r \\cdot \\bhat{e}_3\\end{bmatrix}_\\mc I  \\quad\\mathrm{for}\\quad \\mc I = (\\bhat{e}_1,\\bhat{e}_2,\\bhat{e}_3)$$ \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Any vector can be projected onto any other vector (unit or not, defining a frame or not).  The interpretation of the projection of vector $\\mf a$ onto vector $\\mf b$ is the calculation of the component of $\\mf a$ in the direction of $\\mf b$. Looking again at the <a href=\"#fig:dotproduct\" >figure</a>, above, we see that the process of projection is geometrically linked to the formation of right triangles.  The part of $\\mf a$ that lies in the direction of $\\mf b$ (what we call $\\bhat{b}$) is equal in magnitude to the base of the right triangle whose hypotenuse is given by $\\mf a$ and whose height is the right intersection of a line drawn from the end of $\\mf a$ with $\\mf b$ (this is why pictures are better - all of these words can be needlessly confusing, but they help nail down exactly what is happening). The magnitude of this base is given by the doc product of $\\mf a$ with the direction of $\\mf b$: $\\mf a \\cdot \\bhat{b}$. We can similarly project $\\mf b$ onto $\\mf a$, and the magnitude of this projection will be the length of the base of the right triangle whose height is drawn from the end of $\\mf b$ and makes a right intersection with $\\mf a$.  The magnitude of this base will be $\\mf b \\cdot \\bhat{a}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's consider the case of a vector dotted with itself.  Using the geometric formula given above, we have:\n",
    "$$\\mf a \\cdot \\mf a = \\Vert \\mf a \\Vert \\Vert \\mf a \\Vert \\cos(0) = \\Vert \\mf a \\Vert^2$$\n",
    "where the zero comes from the fact that a vector is parallel to itself, and therefore the angle separating a vector from itself is zero. This is a very important finding, as it gives us a practical way of computing vector norms (more on this soon).\n"

Notice that, unlike in our dot product definition, here we are very specific about the fact that it applies only to geometric vectors (i.e., $\\mb R^3$).  There is no generalization of the cross product to other vector spaces like the inner product generalization for the dot product.

It is tempting to want to similarly map $\\mb R^7$ to our world, and though there are a few correspondences, they are neither as straightforward nor as useful as the ones we find for $\\mb R^3$.  So, basically...don't worry about it.  Treat this as just a quirk of our mathematics, which it most likely is.

    "$\\perp$ means 'perpendicular to', which we now understand (for geometric vectors) to be equivalent to 'orthogonal to'. So, the cross product of vectors $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$ produces a new vector whose magnitude is equal to the product of their magnitudes and the sine of the angle between them, and which points in the direction that is orthogonal to the directions of both vectors. The geometric interpretation of the magnitude of the cross product output is relatively straightforward: $\\Vert \\mf a \\Vert \\Vert \\mf b \\Vert \\sin\\theta$ is equal to the area of the parallelogram whose edges are defined by $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$. Notice that the sine term evaluates to zero for a $\\theta$ of $0^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$.  This means that if $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$ are parallel or anti-parallel, their cross product will be zero.  Similarly, the cross product with itself (or with its own unit direction, or with its additive inverse, or with the direction of its additive inverse) will also be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The direction of the cross-product output is a bit harder.  We start by noting that 'the direction orthogonal to both $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$' is not uniquely defined, even in $\\mb R^3$ (it is not even remotely uniquely defined in other vector spaces, which is why the cross product operator is itself undefined in those other vector spaces).  Looking at the <a href=\"#fig:crossproduct\" >figure</a>, we see that both $\\bhat{c}$ and $-\\bhat{c}$ are equivalently orthogonal to both $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$.  So, how do we select which direction to use for the output of the cross product?  We need another convention, typically known as the 'right-hand rule'.  $\\bhat{c}$ is the direction such that going from $\\mf a$ to $\\mf b$ represents a counter-clockwise rotation.  In your mind, draw an arc between the ends of $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$ in the <a href=\"#fig:crossproduct\" >figure</a>, above.  Follow the arc and note that it is in the counter-clockwise direction.  $\\bhat{c}$ points up in the <a href=\"#fig:crossproduct\" >figure</a> because that is how it must be drawn such that we can look *down* this direction and get a counter-clockwise arc from $\\mf a$ to $\\mf b$.  If we instead were evaluating the cross product $\\mf b \\times \\mf a$, then the same arc would be followed clockwise.  To get it to be in a counter-clockwise direction, we would need to switch our vantage point and be looking at the shaded plane in the <a href=\"#fig:crossproduct\" >figure</a> from below, which would mean switching the direction of $\\bhat{c}$, which is essentially encoding our vantage point.  This is a direct geometric encoding of the anti-commutative property of the cross product.\n",

The transpose of one of these columns will result in a row matrix, whose dimensionality is 1x3 (1 row, 3 columns).  The dimensionality of a matrix multiplication of (1x3)\\*(3x1)= 1x1, otherwise known as a scalar.  So, at the very least, this encoding of the dot product produces the *kind* of output that we want.  Notice also that we didn't put any square braces around the left-hand side of the expression above.  That's because the output of the dot product is a scalar, and *not* a matrix.  One the right-hand side of the expression, we are operating with matrix representations of vectors, and we need for all components to be written in the same frame.  As long as both vectors' components are given in the same frame, the output of the dot product will be the same (we will prove this to ourselves as soon as we learn how to write vector components in multiple frames).\n",

The negative of a matrix should be understood as multiplying the matrix by -1, which is equivalent to flipping the sign of every matrix element.  Since the transpose operator does not modify the contents of the diagonal of a matrix, this definition is telling us that the diagonal elements of a skew-symmetric matrix must equal their own negative values.  The only real number for which this is true is zero, and so every skew-symmetric matrix must have zeros all along the diagonal.  The off-diagonal elements must be symmetric, with opposite signs.  \n",

    "Notice that we can flip the signs on all of the elements in our cross-product equivalent matrix and still get a valid skew-symmetric matrix (i.e., the first row could be 0, $a_3$, $-a_2$, etc.).  So why prefer this version?  This is how the cross-product equivalent matrix encodes the right-hand rule!  If we were to flip the signs, we would be switching to a left-handed convention.  We'll return to this in a while, but do keep it in mind. \n",

    "# Tensors and Outer Products\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that we started our [vector products discussion](#Vector-Products) by stating that we were going to be introducing three different vector products, but we ended up only discussing two.  That's because the third type of vector product requires us to first introduce the concept of **tensors**. Unlike our foray into the fabulous world of vectors, tensors are not directly motivated by Newton's laws.  However, as we continue working our way on a firm mathematical description of these laws, and the exploration of their caveats and implications, we will find tensor formalism enormously helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors can be thought of as a generalization of vectors that allow us to encode multilinear relationships between elements of vector spaces.  The core new concept that we need to add to our toolkit when it comes to tensors is **tensor rank**. The tensor rank (or order) describes the dimensionality of the array of scalars needed to describe the components of a tensor in some basis (reference frame).  So, a rank-0 tensor is a scalar.  A rank-1 tensor is a vector, whose components in some frame are encoded as a 1-D array (or column matrix). A rank-2 tensor, sometimes called a **dyadic**, has components that can be encoded as a 2-D array (or matrix). For our purposes, we will primarily be dealing with rank-2 tensors associated with the Euclidean vector space, with components encoded as 3x3 matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "    In various contexts, what we're calling rank here may be referred to as <b>order</b> or <b>dimensionality</b>, with order being the preferred nomenclature in many texts.  We reserve 'dimensionality' to describe the dimension of the associated vector space (almost always $\\mb R^3$ for us).  Some people insist that 'order' should always be used instead of 'rank' because matrix rank has a very specific (and different) definition in linear algebra (the number of linearly independent rows/columns in the matrix), but tensors are <i>not</i> matrices, and so we are comfortable using 'rank' in this context. Plus, it's fun to piss off mathematicians.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",

Remember that the dot product is an inner product, which means that it is rank-reducing. The dot product between two vectors (rank-1 tensors) produces a scalar. The dot product between a dyadic and a vector produces another vector. So, in the same way that we previously found that $a_i = \\mf a \\cdot \\bhat e_i$ and   $b_i = \\mf b \\cdot \\bhat e_i$ (for the $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$ definitions given above), we can equivalently write:\n",
