    "A reference frame is how we measure space.  It can be thought of as a rigid structure, and, in fact, every rigid body is equivalent to a reference frame (much more on this much later). Because we are trying to span the $\\mb R^3$ vector space, we need three basis elements. We won't go into the proof of this here, but take it as a postulate. Multiple proofs of this assertion are possible, but require setting up some additional mathematical machinery that we won't really need. The three basis elements are linearly independent unit vectors, which makes them mutually orthogonal.  We'll get to an exact definition of orthogonality in a little bit, but conceptually, this means that each of the unit vectors defining the reference frame is rotated exactly 90 degrees from the other two, as in the <a href=\"#fig:refframe\" >figure</a> above. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Components\n",
    "Let's recall the utility of a basis set: it allows us to encode all elements of a vector space as weighted sums of elements of the basis, and this is exactly what a reference frame does for us.  By defining a reference frame, we can write any geometric vector as a sum of its **components**. So, as in the <a href=\"#fig:refframe\" >figure</a>, once you have defined a reference frame $\\mc I$ with mutually orthogonal unit directions $\\bhat e_1, \\bhat e_2, \\bhat e_3$, the position of point $P$ with respect to point $O$ can be expressed as the weighted sum:\n",
    "$$\\mf r_{P/O} = x_1 \\bhat{e}_1 +  x_2 \\bhat{e}_2 + x_3 \\bhat{e}_3$$\n",
    "The component weights ($x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$) are sometimes referred to as the **measure numbers** of the vector in the particular reference frame being used. \n",
    "\n",
    "At some point in your life, someone may have told you that a geometric vector was a list (or array) of three scalar values.  That person was lying to you.  You should find them, and make them ashamed.  The array of three scalars represents the components of a vector in a particular reference frames.  Euclidean vectors by themselves are purely geometric objects - they exist and are fully defined in the absence of any reference frame definition.  However, once we have defined a reference frame, it is frequently convenient to express our vectors in its components.  When we do this, we must be careful to never lose sight of which frame (or frames) we're working with.  One notational solution would be to always write out the full summation including the unit vectors, as in the equation above, but this is cumbersome.  Instead, we'll introduce a new notational convention to help us along. For any vector $\\mf r$, we will denote its components in a frame $\\mc I$ as $\\left[\\mf r \\right]_\\mc I$.  The square brackets remind us that the component representation is a list of scalars, which we choose (for reasons that will become clearer momentarily) to describe as an array.  The right subscript reminds us of the frame these components belong to.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with this new notation, the previous equation becomes:\n",
    "$$\\left[\\mf r_{P/O} \\right]_\\mc I = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix}_\\mc I$$\n",
    "Notice two things: first, there is an implicit order of the frame unit vectors (such that the component $x_1$ corresponds to direction $\\bhat{e}_1$, etc.).  This means that it is crucial to state your frame unit vector order when you define it.  In this case, we can state that $\\mc I= \\left(\\bhat{e}_1, \\bhat{e}_2, \\bhat{e}_3\\right)$. Second, note that we have written the component array as a column matrix (as opposed to a row matrix). Our convention will be to *always* express component arrays as column matrices (again, there's a specific reason for this that will be revealed in a little bit). "

Notice how this exercise had the components of the vector be functions of multiple variables, i.e. $a+c$, $b+c$, etc.? That was actually a sneaky way of getting us into a discussion on coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have learned at some point in your life, that **coordinate systems** and reference frames were the same thing.  Once again, this is entirely and utterly wrong (you know what to do).  There is a crucial distinction between these two concepts.  Reference frames are basis sets for geometric vectors. The components of a vector in a particular reference frame can be written as *functions* of **coordinates**. Coordinates are therefore scalar quantities that allow us to parametrize how we measure the systems we are analyzing. In **analytical mechanics** (which is just classical mechanics, but fancier), we use **generalized coordinates**.  Generalized coordinates are just that - a complete generalization of the concept of coordinate systems.  We'll touch on this concept briefly here, and then come back to it much later.  Assume that we have a set of generalized coordinates, that we will call $q_1, q_2, q_3, \\ldots q_n$ (that is, we have $n$ distinct generalized coordinates).  Assume also that we have some position vector, $\\mf r$ that is relevant to the analysis of the system for which we defined these generalized coordinates.  Given these two assumptions, what we're really saying is that we can write the components of $\\mf r$ in some reference frame $\\mc I$ as:\n",
    "$$\\left[\\mf r_{P/O} \\right]_\\mc I = \\begin{bmatrix} f_1(q_1, q_2, q_3, \\ldots q_n) \\\\ f_2(q_1, q_2, q_3, \\ldots q_n) \\\\ f_3(q_1, q_2, q_3, \\ldots q_n) \\end{bmatrix}_\\mc I$$\n",
    "where $f_1, f_2$, and $f_3$ are functions or some or all of the generalized coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cartesian Coordinates\n",
    "Ok, that's all fine, but doesn't seem really helpful.  Let's nail down this concept by thinking about specific coordinate systems. The simplest option are the **Cartesian** coordinates (named in honor of René Descartes, who thought about himself a lot). These coordinates correspond 1:1 to the unit vectors of your reference frame.  When we write:\n",
    "$$\\left[\\mf r_{P/O} \\right]_\\mc I = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix}_\\mc I$$\n",
    "what we're really saying is that $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are Cartesian coordinates. If we go back to being super pedantic for just a second, the Cartesian coordinates represent the case where $f_1(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1$, $f_2(x_1, x_2, x_3) =  x_2$ and $f_3(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_3$.  Any time you have scalar values that are exactly equal to the measure numbers of components along each of the 3 unit vectors defining a reference frame, you are dealing with Cartesian coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce two more coordinate systems: **cylindrical** coordinates (often called **polar** coordinates when you are working in 2D) and **spherical** coordinates.\n",

    "## Polar/Cylindrical Coordinates\n",
    "Polar/Cylindrical coordinates are useful for tracking radial (circular or closed path) motion in a single plane.  The polar coordinates $\\rho, \\theta$ map to the Cartesian coordinates as $x = \\rho\\cos\\theta$ and $y = \\rho\\sin\\theta$. Thus, we can write:\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that we have made a distinction between the polar coordinate radius ($\\rho$) and spherical coordinate radius $r$.  These are two very different quantities.  The spherical radius $r$ is the magnitude of the position vector.  The polar radius $\\rho$, on the other hand, is the **projection** of the spherical radius onto the $\\bhat{e}_1-\\bhat{e}_2$ plane.  We're not quite ready to formally define projection, but we will, in just a little bit. The intuitive understanding of projection can be seen in the <a href=\"#fig:cylsphercoords\" >figure</a>, above: if we split $\\mf r_{P/O}$ into two vectors, one of which lies in the $\\bhat{e}_1-\\bhat{e}_2$ plane and one of which is orthogonal to that plane, then $r$ will be the magnitude of the vector that's in the $\\bhat{e}_1-\\bhat{e}_2$ plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "Here's a thing: mathematicians and physicists suck.  We fundamentally cannot agree on a single, universal, spherical coordinate definition.  So, you will find some references using $\\theta$ as an azimuth angle and some using $\\phi$ as an azimuth. Some references will define spherical coordinates as we have here, using an azimuth and zenith angle, while others will use an azimuth and an elevation.  If you think this is all needlessly confusing, you are 100% correct. For the remainder of this text, whenever we talk about spherical coordinates in general, we will be assuming the definition given above.  However, occasionally we will bring up specific, named, spherical coordinate systems, and many of these will use elevation angles.  Whenever this happens, we will make a specific note of it.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "An incredibly important thing has happened here (did you spot it?).  We have written the components of the same vector ($\\mf r_{P/O}$) in the same reference frame ($\\mc I$) in three completely different ways.  The key takeaway is that every reference frame can have an *infinite* number of coordinate systems associated with them.  Remember: reference frames tell us how to decompose space into three directions.  Coordinate systems tell us how to go about evaluating the components of a vector in a particular reference frame.  They work together, but serve different functions. Because the Cartesian coordinates map directly to measurements taken along each of the three unit vectors composing a reference frame, all coordinate systems can be thought of as algebraic mappings to the Cartesian coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cartesian, Cylindrical, and Spherical coordinates are by no means the only standard coordinate systems available to us, but they are, by far, the most ubiquitous and the ones we will turn to most often.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coordinate Origin\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the concepts of reference frames and coordinate systems are so closely linked, some  find it useful to expand the reference frame nomenclature established above, and, when defining a reference frame, to also include a coordinate system origin.  Note that there is absolutely no requirement to do so - a reference frame is fully defined without any coordinate system definitions, and consists solely of three unit vectors.  However, in practice, we will almost always wish to associate coordinates with our reference frames, and these coordinates must be defined as being measured *from* somewhere - hence the perceived need for a coordinate system origin.  Notationally, we represent this by adding a point to our reference frame definition.  Thus, for the frame $\\mc I$ depicted in the <a href=\"#fig:cylsphercoords\" >figure</a>, we could write: $\\mc I = \\left(O, \\bhat{e}_1, \\bhat{e}_2, \\bhat{e}_3\\right)$, which tells us that the Cartesian coordinates associated with this frame all equal zero at point $O$.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, our other bit of notational formalism - always writing position vectors in terms of the points they connect - obviates the need for this notational extension. When we define the components of a vector as:\n",
    "$$\\left[\\mf r_{P/O} \\right]_\\mc I = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix}_\\mc I$$\n",
    "we are automatically setting the origin of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ to $O$.  We can, using the exact same definition of $\\mc I$, write:\n",
    "$$\\left[\\mf r_{P/Q} \\right]_\\mc I = \\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ y_3 \\end{bmatrix}_\\mc I$$\n",
    "and know that the origin of $(y_1, y_2, y_3)$ is $Q$, but that each of these quantities is measured in the same direction as their $x_i$ counterparts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other utility in packaging a coordinate system origin along with our reference frame definition is to automatically provide a fixed point within the reference frame (important in the context of Newtonian mechanics).  We will make use of both conventions, but will usually prefer the basic reference frame definition, omitting a coordinate system origin point unless it is important to include one. "
