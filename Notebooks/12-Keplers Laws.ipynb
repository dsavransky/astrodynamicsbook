    "Do yourself a favor and take a few minutes to read through the Wikipedia article on Johannes Kepler.  Better yet, pick up a real biography (say something by Arthur Koestler).  It's ok. We'll wait. Suffice it to say, the man's life was fascinating.  He plays into our story, however, in that, about 78 years before Newton published his *Principia* (which contains, among other things, much of the line of derivation that we have been following so far), Kepler published *Astronomia nova*, which contained his three laws of planetary motion.  These were not based on derivation from a set of postulates (e.g., Newton's laws), but rather were postulates themselves, crafted based on meticulous observations of the motion of other solar system bodies, and in particular, of Mars.  Most of these observations were recorded by Tycho Brahe, whose life also merits close scrutiny.  You may have heard about the nose, but that's only the start of it - there's a drunk, pet elk in there. \n",

    "Kepler's laws were revolutionary, and an incredibly impressive feat of geometry and data fitting.  The fact that they are instantly reproducible using Newton's laws and calculus methods is more impressive still. Despite being superseded by more basic postulates, Kepler's laws are still very much worth studying as they provide quite a bit of intuitive understanding on the *geometry* of two-body orbits.  "

    "In this case, the semi-major axis (its absolute value) is the distance along the eccentricity vector direction (which is still orthogonal to the directrix and passes through the periapsis points) between the vertex of either branch of the hyperbola and the geometric center.  The semi-minor axis is the height to the asymptote from the vertex (orthogonal to the semi-minor axis).  The linear eccentricity is again the distance from either focus to the geometric center and can be shown (using much the same approach as we took for the elliptical case) to be $c = \\vert a \\vert e$. Similarly, we find that $\\ell = \\dfrac{b^2}{\\vert a\\vert} \\equiv a\\left(1-e^2\\right)$ and the exact same relationship for the focal parameter: $p = \\dfrac{\\ell}{e}$.\n",

Parabolas technically have infinite semi-major axes (in the sense that the vacant focus is infinitely far from the filled focus), so in this case, we redefine the $a$ parameter to be the distance between the parabola's vertex and the directrix.  This is also equal to the distance between the vertex and focus, which makes the semi-parameter evaluate to 2$a$.  The linear eccentricity is undefined (infinite) and all other previously derived relationships stay the same. \n",
