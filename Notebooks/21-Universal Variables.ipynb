    "While we have now provided ourselves with methods for propagating any type of orbit corresponding to any of the open or closed conic sections, there's an extra bit of processing that constantly has to happen as we check on the type of orbit we're dealing with, and determine which anomaly we should be calculating, and which equations we should be applying.  This isn't really a huge deal, but it does tend to make code more complicated, and more complex code invariably means buggier code.  More importantly, it's not *elegant*. We have a completely unified description of *all* orbit types via the orbital state vectors.  Why can't we have a unified description in orbital elements?\n",

    "    Never underestimate the importance of the dual principles of parsimony and elegance in science and engineering.  There's not only beauty, but extreme utility in simplicity.  Simple solutions should always be preferred to more complex ones because simple solutions are so much less likely to fail in new and exciting ways, just when you least expect them to.  Note, however, that 'simple' is not synonymous with 'brief', especially when it comes to code.  If your incredibly clever one-liner replaces a dozen lines of code but is incomprehensible to anyone but you, then it is not the more elegant solution.  When using highly idiomatic languages like Python, elegance resides in utilizing the language's standard idioms, and eschewing obscure and confuscated approaches.\n",

    "All that's left for us to do now is to figure out how to compute $\\chi$ for a given $\\Delta t$.  Note that nothing we've done here has mitigated the transcendental nature of the time equation (and nothing ever will). We have hidden away the various trigonometric terms that make our lives difficult, but they're all still there, and there is no way to directly invert the equation for $n\\Delta{t}$ to solve for $\\chi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's okay.  We've already provided ourself with a robust method for inverting the time equation via Newton-Raphson iteration, and we can once again return to this well-trod ground here. We go back to our fundamental definition of the universal variable:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\intd{\\chi}}{\\intd{t}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu}}{r} \\quad \\Longrightarrow\\quad \\sqrt{\\mu}\\intd{t} = r\\intd{\\chi}\\quad \\Longrightarrow\\quad \\sqrt{\\mu}\\Delta{t} = \\int r\\intd{\\chi}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus take our minimization function to be:\n",
    "$$ f(\\chi) = \\sqrt{\\mu}\\Delta{t} - \\int r\\intd{\\chi} \\quad  \\Longrightarrow\\quad f'(\\chi) =\\frac{\\intd{f}}{\\intd{\\chi}} = -r$$\n",
    "with the iterant defined as:\n",
    "$$ \\chi_{n+1} = \\chi_n - \\frac{f(\\chi_n)}{f'(\\chi_n)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have already evaluated the integral of r with respect to $\\chi$, above, when finding our original expression for $\\sqrt{\\mu}\\Delta{t}$.  Returning to this result, we can write out the full form of the iterant as:\n",

    "As always, there is the question of selecting initial conditions. Let's return to our first expression for $r$ (remembering that it carries the implicit assumption that $a > 0$):\n",
    "$$r = a\\left(1 + e\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\chi + c_o}{\\sqrt{a}} \\right)\\right) = a(1-e\\cos(E))$$\n",

    "where we have taken advantage of the fact that cosine and sine are exactly phase shifted by 90$^\\circ$.  Thus:\n",
    "$$E = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\chi + c_o}{\\sqrt{a}}$$\n",

    "Since the hyperbolic equations end up doing exactly what their trigonometric counterparts do, this also tells us that:\n",

    "  At this point, you might be thinking that $c_2$ and $c_3$ are undefined for $\\psi = 0$.  Nope!  You've forgotten about L'Hôpital's rule (or just Taylor Expansion).  Both the numerator and denominator of $c_2$ and $c_3$ evaluate to zero for $\\psi = 0$, and so their value is the limit of the derivative of the numerator divided by the derivative of the denominator as $\\psi \\to 0$.  Working this out, we find that for $\\psi = 0$, $c_2 = \\dfrac{1}{2}$ and $c_3 = \\dfrac{1}{6}$.  Go ahead and check to make sure you agree.\n",
