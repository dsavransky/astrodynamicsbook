    "# Newton's Laws, Revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we were talking about Newton's laws?  Well, this isn't Tristram Shandy, and we are actually going to get back to Newton's laws. We have built up a fairly staggering mathematical edifice upon the meager hints given to us by the form of Newton's first and second law.  Newton's second law tells us that we are dealing with things that are easily describable by vectors.  Newton's first law tells that the laws apply in a particular frame of reference in which forces produce straight-line motion.  We call these frames **inertial** and there are an infinite number of them.  The idea that Newton's laws apply equally in all inertial frames is typically called the principle of **Galilean relativity** (or Galilean invariance), named after the famous citizen of Pisa who apocryphally dropped things off the equally famous tower and really, really pissed off the Catholic church, and whose contributions to science are awe-inspiring. \n",
    "\n",
    "Galilean invariance basically boils down to the idea that if one frame is inertial, and another frame has no acceleration with respect to the first frame (as in, no point fixed in the second frame can be said to be accelerating with respect to any point fixed in the first frame) then the second frame is inertial as well, and Newton's laws apply equally in both frames.  Of course, we haven't really formally defined acceleration, so let's correct that now. \n",

    "# Kinematics\n",
    "\n",
    "The **kinematics** of a mass are the mathematical descriptions of the mass's position and motion in space.  They are the 'alteration of motion' side of Newton's second law.  We describe the position of a particle (point mass) $P$ with respect to point $O$ via the **position vector** $\\mf r_{P/O}$.  Typically, $O$ is fixed within an inertial reference frame (which we'll call $\\mc I$), but, as we'll see in a bit, could also be moving in $\\mc I$ with a constant velocity.  The **inertial velocity vector** of $P$ with respect to $O$ is the inertial derivative in time of $\\mf r_{P/O}$:\n",
    "$$\\leftexp{\\mc I}{\\mf v_{P/O}} \\triangleq \\fddt{I}\\mf r_{P/O}$$\n",

    "# General Pedantry on the Nature of Physical Laws and Mass\n",
    "\n",
    "It's really important to remember that Newton's laws are **laws** and not **theories**.  Laws are descriptions of how some aspect of the physical universe behaves under a very specific set of circumstances.  Laws are essentially postulates: they describe but do not explain.  A theory, on the other hand, is an explanation of the functioning of some aspect of the physical universe and can incorporate a broad range of facts, laws, inferences, and meticulously tested hypotheses.  Theories explain while laws only prescribe. Being a law means never having to say you're sorry.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is why Newton's laws can get away with so much wishy-washiness, and why we've been incredibly cavalier about defining some of the terms involved.  Because all of the definitions are going to be incredibly circular. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is a force? A force is something that changes the motion (momentum) of a body (mass).  What is mass?  Mass is the property of a body which determines how its motion (momentum) is modified by the application of force. It is the constant property of a body (or at least one whose mass is not changing in time) that acts as the constant of proportionality in Newton's second law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern physics has managed to almost entirely do away with the need for forces, and has provided us with a much, much better definition of what mass actually *is*. However, for our purposes, the circular definitions are actually incredibly useful, and so we will just stick with them.  Just remember that they are postulates.  Like the existence of Galilean/Newtonian inertial reference frames, we have to assume that they exist and are just the things that obey the mathematical rules we posited.  We then make predictions based on these mathematical rules and compare them to observations of the physical universe.  In a *shockingly* high percentage of cases, the predictions will match our observations (assuming sufficient fidelity of the models that the laws are applied to) to an incredible precision.  Where we expect the laws to lead us astray (i.e., where we stray away from the 'specific set of circumstances' assumed by Newton's laws), we will be sure to note this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that we have been saying **particle** or **point mass** to describe the application of Newton's laws.  The original laws, as stated up to this point, apply only to point masses - infinitesimal bodies possessing only mass but not extent.  We will have to do some more work to extend Newton's laws to extended bodies.  For now, remember that Newtonian particles are non-physical - they are not atoms or molecules or anything else we can point to in the actual universe.  They are mathematical abstractions having mass and kinematics, but no orientation."

    "We have now picked up three new accelerations, associated with three fictitious force terms.  The first, $-m \\alpharot{I}{B} \\times \\mf r_{P/O'}$ is due to the angular acceleration term, which accounts for any change in the angular velocity of $\\mc B$ in time. It is frequently referred to as the **Euler force** with the associated acceleration ($\\alpharot{I}{B} \\times \\mf r_{P/O'}$) called the Euler acceleration or transverse acceleration. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second term, $-2m\\omegarot{I}{B}\\times\\leftexp{\\mc B}{\\mf v_{P/O'}}$, is known as the **Coriolis force**, named in honor of French mechanical engineer Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis, a man who really knew his way about a waterwheel.  This fictitious force acts in the direction orthogonal to the $\\mc B$ frame velocity, causing a deflection of the moving mass within the rotating frame.  The most readily observable effects of the Coriolis force can be seen in large-scale atmospheric systems, where the rotating frame is the entire rotating Earth, itself.  The Coriolis force helps give rise to spiraling wind patterns, ultimately leading to hurricanes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the third term, $-m\\omegarot{I}{B} \\times \\left(\\omegarot{I}{B} \\times \\mf r_{P/O'}\\right)$ is known as the **Centrifugal force**.  Remember that the result of a cross product is a vector orthogonal to both vectors being crossed.  In this case, the first cross product produces a result orthogonal to both $\\omegarot{I}{B}$ and $\\mf r_{P/O'}$ while the second cross product produces a vector orthogonal to this result and $\\omegarot{I}{B}$.  If we consider a planar system (i.e., one where all motion lies in a single plane) then both position and velocity will be constrained to this plane while the angular velocity will be orthogonal to it.  In this case, the two cross products would produce a result that is anti-parallel to $\\mf r_{P/O'}$.  As the centrifugal force acts opposite the direction of this triple product, it would act in the direction parallel to $\\mf r_{P/O'}$ - that is, pushing the mass away from the origin of the rotating frame.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "    The nomenclature associated with the centrifugal force is a <i>mess</i>.  Centrifugal (from the Latin <i>centrifuga</i>) literally means \"center-fleeing.\"  The opposite of this is a <b>centripetal</b> force (literally \"center-seeking\"). As the fictitious force (at least in the planar case) does act along the position vector (away from the center of motion), the 'center-fleeing' name makes sense.  However, some texts will also call the associated acceleration (which acts in the opposite direction) as centrifugal as well, which is inconsistent.  A centrifugal acceleration would also act away from the origin of the rotating frame: $-\\omegarot{I}{B} \\times \\left(\\omegarot{I}{B} \\times \\mf r_{P/O'}\\right)$.  To make matters worse, the term centripetal force/acceleration is typically used to describe any force that causes a body to follow a curved path.  In this case, the force is real, and not fictitious, but analyzing the body's dynamics in the resulting rotating frame can give rise to centrifugal force terms.  Finally, there is the concept of a <b>reactive centrifugal force</b>, which is a third law reaction force acting opposite to the centripetal force being applied to a body forced into curved path motion. So, it's all kind of a mess.  However, if you don't worry too much about the words, and simply keep the equations consistent, and keep track of which frames you're operating in, the appropriate acceleration/force terms will appear as they should. \n",
