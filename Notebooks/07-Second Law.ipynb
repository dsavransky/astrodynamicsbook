    "# Newton's Second Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we were talking about Newton's laws?  Well, this isn't Tristram Shandy, and we are going to get back to Newton's laws. We have built up a fairly staggering mathematical edifice upon the meager hints given to us by the form of Newton's first and second law.  Newton's second law tells us that we are dealing with things that are easily describable by vectors.  Newton's first law tells that the laws apply in a particular frame of reference in which forces produce straight-line motion.  We call these frames **inertial** and there are an infinite number of them.  The idea that Newton's laws apply equally in all inertial frames is typically called the principle of **Galilean relativity** (or Galilean invariance), named after the famous citizen of Pisa who apocryphally dropped things off the equally famous tower and really, really pissed off the Catholic church, and whose contributions to science were awe-inspiring.
