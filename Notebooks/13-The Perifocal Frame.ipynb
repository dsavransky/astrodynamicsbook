All orbital motion occurs in the plane orthogonal to the specific angular momentum, and the eccentricity vector also lies within this plane, which we will henceforth call the **perifocal plane**.  Thus, $\\mf e$ and $\\mf h$  are orthogonal, and if we introduce a third mutually orthogonal direction $\\bhat q \\triangleq \\bhat h \\times \\bhat e$ then we can define a hugely useful reference frame:\n",

Two of the defining unit directions are inertially fixed ($\\bhat e$ and $\\bhat{h}$) which means that the frame has zero angular velocity in any inertial frame.  Some conventions will place the coordinate origin of this frame at the location of the central body of the two-body orbit, and because this point has a non-zero inertial acceleration, this tends to lead to much argument and general brouhaha. And it is all entirely pointless - for our purposes, only the unit directions matter, and these are fixed within any inertial frame, and thus, the perifocal frame is inertial. If you absolutely must assign the perifocal frame a coordinate origin and cannot bear to use the location of the central body, just set it to be the barycenter of the two bodies. Basta!\n",

    "In general, the angle between $\\mf r$ and $\\mf v$ is entirely arbitrary, but there exist special points in all orbits, called **turning points**, at which these two vectors will be orthogonal. Turning points occur when the orbital radius vector is parallel (or anti-parallel) to the eccentricity vector.  **Closed orbits** (ellipses) will have two turning points, while **open orbits** (parabolae and hyperbolae) will have only one turning point.  Circles, which in most cases can be treated as a special case of ellipse, are actually a bit different, in that, depending on how you think about it, either every point on a circular orbit is a turning point or there are no turning points.  Since a circle has zero eccentricity, the eccentricity vector is not well defined (it has zero magnitude and no fixed direction - something we'll come back to in a bit).  As such, there are no particular points on a circular orbit where we can say that the radius vector is aligned with the eccentricity vector.  On the other hand, the orbital radius and velocity vectors are mutually orthogonal at all points on a circular orbit.  We can see this by evaluating the unit vectors associated with each for the case where $e = 0$:\n",

We denote the orbital radius and velocity vectors at the turning points by $\\mf r_t$ and $\\mf v_t$, respectively, and write: $\\mf r_t \\parallel \\mf e$.

    "Yes, this is sufficiently useful to warrant its own blue box.  Don't be like that.  Returning to the specific case of turning points, we note that $\\bhat{r}_t \\equiv \\pm\\bhat{e}$ (the $\\pm$ due to the fact that the two vectors can be parallel or anti-parallel) and that we can always write $\\mf e = e \\bhat{e}$, we find:\n",

    "\n",
    "This again confirms that $\\mf r_t \\perp \\mf v_t$ (since $\\bhat{q}$ is orthogonal to $\\bhat{e}$), but much more interestingly, by comparing this expression to the general velocity vector written in components of the perifocal frame, we see that the turning points must occur with $\\nu = 0,\\pi$ (these are the only locations where $\\sin(\\nu) = 0$ and there is no component in the $\\bhat{e}$ direction.  As you've probably already noticed, the turning points are the [apsides](<12-Keplers Laws.ipynb#Apsides>)!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is easily confirmed by the geometry of our orbits and the conic section solution for the orbital radius magnitude.  Remember that $\\nu$ is the angle between $\\mf r$ and $\\mf e$, meaning that $\\mf r_t \\parallel \\mf e$ requires $\\nu_t = 0,\\pi$. The orbital radius at these points evaluates to:\n",
    "$$r_t = \\frac{\\ell}{1 \\pm e}$$\n",
    "Since the semi-parameter is a constant, these two points correspond to the maximum and minimum separations between the two bodies.  In the case of open orbits, only the periapsis lies on the orbit, as the apoapsis lies at infinity. \n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "    This does not mean, however, that a body on an open orbit must necessarily cross periapsis.  If the body was injected onto the orbit <i>after</i> the periapsis point (as in the case of a maneuvering spacecraft or a natural body whose orbit is being modified by some external forces), then it will simply continue receeding from the central body for all time (or until the orbit is modified again).\n",
