    "# Vector Derivatives in Time\n",
    "\n",
    "A really important thing to hold on to as we start this discussion is that geometric vectors are frame-independent. This means that every single position vector we have written down so far exists as an abstract geometric blob and is fully defined absent the definition of any reference frame at all.  Unfortunately, this ceases to be the case when we start thinking about how these geometric vectors may evolve in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "Vector derivatives must be defined with respect to a reference frame.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, imagine a box moving freely (rotating and otherwise accelerating) in 3D space.  In the box, there's a ball moving around freely.  We call one corner of the box point $O$ and the location of the ball at any given time point $P$.  The position of the ball with respect to the corner of the box ($\\mf r_{P/O}$) really is a frame-independent quantity.  An observer traveling inside the box and another observer standing outside the box (let's imaging it's a glass house) would both agree on the magnitude and direction of this vector in any common reference frame they chose to adopt.  However, the story changes if you ask the two observers about the **velocity** (the time derivative of position) of the ball.  The observer traveling with the box would describe only the part of the change in the position of the ball due to the ball's motion inside the box.  The external observer would describe a rate of change that included both the ball's motion within the box, as well as the motion of the whole box itself.  This isn't just a matter of describing things in components of different frames.  The velocity vectors the two observers are describing are actually different!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, we tried for some physical intuition, let's see if we can get more clarity (or a complementary view) from the math side of things.  We assume that our position vector $\\mathbf{r}_{P/O}$ has Cartesian coordinates $a_1, a_2, a_3$ in some reference frame $\\mc A = (O, \\bhat{a}_1, \\bhat{a}_2, \\bhat{a}_3)$. The vector can therefore be written as:\n",
    "$$ \\mf r_{P/O} = a_1 \\bhat{a}_1 + a_2 \\bhat{a}_2 + a_3 \\bhat{a}_3 =  \\sum_{i=1}^3 a_i \\bhat{a}_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's try differentiating a vector.  We don't necessarily know how to differentiate a vector, but we do know how to differentiate a scalar, so let's assume that all the things we know about scalar differentiation also apply to vectors.\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "If you are not comfortable with scalar differentiation, and, in particular, the chain rule, stop now, go grab a mathematics text (or equivalent resource) and bring yourself up to speed.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things we know about differentiation is the product rule, which tells us that, since each component of our vector is composed of the product of two parts (the scalar measure number and the unit vector direction), we should expect our derivative to have two terms for each component, or six terms total.  This would look something like:\n",
    "$$ \\fddt{}\\mf r_{P/O} = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\dot{a}_i \\bhat{a}_i + \\sum_{i=1}^3 a_i \\fddt{}\\bhat{a}_i $$\n",
    "where we have continued with the convention of overdots representing scalar derivatives in time. We don't seem to have gained much here, as we still have three terms that are derivatives of the $\\bhat{a}_i$ unit vectors that we still don't quite know what to do with.  Here's where the frame-dependent nature of vector derivatives comes into play.  \n",

    "The time derivative of a vector defining a reference frame, <i>with respect to that same reference frame</i> is zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's think about that statement a bit.  It kind of *feels* correct, right?  If a unit direction is used as and element of the basis set defining a reference frame, then, no matter how that frame moves through space, the unit direction isn't changing within the frame.  We've already introduced the concept of treating reference frames synonymously with rigid bodies. Let's go back to the example of the room floating through space.  We placed our coordinate origin at one corner of the room.  Assuming the room is a perfect rectangular solid, then the two walls and floor (or ceiling) meeting at that corner are mutually orthogonal and (when properly ordered) constitute a reference frame.  If the room doesn't deform or warp, then the unit directions following the edges of the room remain the same, within the context of the room, for all time.  Assuming you buy all of that, we can now complete our definition of frame-specific vector derivatives.  We will represent vector differentiation with respect to a specific frame by adding a left superscript to the derivative operator, as well as the output of the differentiation.  That is, if $\\mf v$ is defined as the time derivative of $\\mf r$ in frame $\\mc I$, then we will write:\n",
    "$$ \\leftexp{\\mc I}{\\mf v} \\triangleq \\fddt{I}\\mf r $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now, we can finally get to our formal definition of vector differentiation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    " A vector $\\mf r_{P/O} = a_1 \\bhat a_1 + a_2 \\bhat a_2 + a_3 \\bhat a_3$ is differentiable in time at a time $t_1$ with respect to frame $\\mc A = (O, \\bhat a_1, \\bhat a_2, \\bhat a_3)$ if $a_1(t), a_2(t), a_3(t)$ are differentiable at $t = t_1$.  Then:\n",
    "$$\\left.\\fddt{A}\\mf r_{P/O}\\right|_{t = t_1} = \\left.\\frac{\\intd{a_1}}{\\intd{t}}\\right|_{t = t_1}\\bhat a_1 +\\left.\\frac{\\intd{a_2}}{\\intd{t}}\\right|_{t = t_1}\\bhat a_2+\\left.\\frac{\\intd{a_3}}{\\intd{t}}\\right|_{t = t_1} \\bhat a_3 $$\n",

    "\n",
    "If each of the $a_i$ functions are continuously differentiable, then we can replace this with the simpler statement:\n",
    "$$\\fddt{A}\\mf r_{P/O} = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\dot{a}_i \\bhat{a}_i $$\n",

    "## Component Representations of Vector Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's be very clear here, because usually this is the part that trips people up: The frame-dependent nature of vector derivatives is wholly separate from our ability to express the components of a vector with respect to multiple frames.  We can express the derivative of $\\mf r_{P/O}$ with respect to the $\\mc A$ frame in components of the $\\mc A$ frame, or in components of the $\\mc B$ frame, or in any other frame we choose.  Transforming the components of our vector derivative between frames is done via exactly the same DCMs we have already been using, and follows all the same rules.  In our notation, this looks like:\n",
    "$$ \\left[\\fddt{A}\\mf r_{P/O}\\right]_\\mc B = \\framerot{B}{A}\\left[\\fddt{A}\\mf r_{P/O}\\right]_\\mc A $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if we define another variable as the output of the derivative, such as $\\leftexp{\\mc A}{\\mf v_{P/O}} \\triangleq \\fddt{A}\\mf r_{P/O}$, then we could write:\n",
    "$$ \\left[\\leftexp{\\mc A}{\\mf v_{P/O}}\\right]_\\mc B = \\framerot{B}{A}\\left[\\leftexp{\\mc A}{\\mf v_{P/O}}\\right]_\\mc A $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again: the frame we're differentiating with respect to, and the frame whose components we choose to express the result in, are entirely independent of one another. They could be the same frame, or they could be two different frames.  As always, allow the notation to help you keep track (or come up with your own notation that accomplished the task): the left superscript tells us about what frame we're differentiating with respect to, and the right subscript tells us about the frame whose components we're using.

    "# Vector Derivatives Across Frames\n",

    "Great. We have rather cleverly obviated the need to figure what vector derivatives really mean by providing ourselves with a frame-dependent differentiation mechanism in which the derivatives of all of the vector parts are exactly zero. Go us.  And yet... That last bit there should give you pause.  If you can express a vector in components of any frame, there may be times when you wish to differentiate the unit vector of one frame with respect to another frame.  And that brings us all the way back to our original problem.  Namely, how exactly do we evaluate something like $\\fddt{B}{\\mf a_1}$?  Sigh. We're going to have to keep going with this, aren't we?  Unfortunately, to get to where we want to go, we're going to have to take a pretty hefty detour.  Get set."

There's some tenuous connection there.  DCMs tell us how to transform between component of different frames, and we were just discussion differentiation across frames. So, maybe?  In reality, we are about to embark on a fairly extended series of derivations, and we will start by positing the form of a quantity (the angular velocity matrix), and end by showing how it ties in with everything we've done so far.  In essence, we're making a guess and then proving that it was a good one.
