    "# Newtonian Gravity \n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to introduce a new bit of physics, and add a fourth law to the three we've been using so far.  This is Newton's Law of Gravity, sometimes called Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. Once again, it is incredibly important to understand that it is a *law*, and postulates specific behavior that closely matches what we observe in the physical universe, most of the time, and under most conditions.  Modern physics now provides us with a better understanding of gravity, via Einstein's general theory of relativity, but it turns out that Newton's law works amazingly well in the vast majority of cases, and can almost *always* be used to get a very good first approximation for the dynamics of gravitational systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "    The use of <i>better</i> to describe general relativity is not a value judgment. It is merely shorthand for 'makes predictions that more closely agree with observed phenomena over a broader range of conditions'. We also know relativity to be incomplete, as it does not (yet) play nicely with quantum mechanics.  The theory of gravity will keep being developed as new discoveries are made and new theories proposed.  Newton's law of gravity, however, is immutable, and will remain the same forever.\n",

    "    Another aside: you will frequently hear (usually from physics majors) statements along the lines of: \"gravity is not a force.\"  This is honestly a bit of useless pedantry.  Yes, general relativity describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime due to uneven distribution of masses.  However, remember that we never actually defined what a force <i>is</i>.  Forces are the things that accelerate masses.  Gravity, in whatever flavor you happen to prefer, causes masses to move in particular ways, and apparently accelerate from the vantage point of an external observer.  Hence, insisting that gravity isn't a force is a bit silly.\n",

This is known as the **two-body problem** and is illustrated in the <a href=\"#fig:2bodyframe\" >figure</a>, above. This system is incredibly important as it is the *only* gravitational system with a complete, closed-form, analytic solution.  All other gravitational systems require numerical integration in order to accurately predict the trajectories of constituent masses.  Newton's law of universal gravitation posits that the force on mass $m_1$ due to gravitational interaction with mass $m_2$ is given by:\n",

    "Why is the number of constants so important?  Because 5 is as many independent constants that this system can possibly have!  In general, in 3 dimensions, every Newtonian particle has 3 **degrees of freedom** (often abbreviated as DOF).  The number of degrees of freedom in a system is equal to the number of required [generalized coordinates](<01-Introduction.ipynb#Coordinate-Systems>) needed to describe the system, and equal to the number of second-order differential equations of motion produced by the application of Newton's second law. A system with $d$ DOF can have at *most* $2d-1$ constants of motion - a maximally constrained system boils down to a single free parameter (typically something mapping to time - in the case of our two-body conic section solution, the true anomaly, which is a time-varying quantity). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our system consists of 2 particles in 3 dimensions, and so it would seem as if it has 6 DOF, but the particles are constrained to follow paths dictated by their gravitational interactions.  Factoring in the constraints, our two-body system actually has only 3 degrees of freedom (hence being able to describe the motion using the orbital radius vector, which consists of only 3 scalar quantities), and, as we have shown, 5 independent conserved quantities.  Thus, the two-body system has the maximum possible number of constants of motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Systems with exactly $2d - 1$ constants are called **maximally superintegrable** while systems with $d$ or more constraints are just superintegrable. However, as soon as we add even just one more particle to our original two, all of this instantly goes away.  The N-body system has exactly ten conserved quantities (three from conservation of total linear momentum, three from conservation of total angular momentum, three from the constant velocity of the barycenter, and one from conservation of total energy).  With three bodies, we must describe each of their positions with respect to the barycenter, and so we nominally have 9 degrees of freedom, meaning that there are now only $d+1$ constants.  With each additional body, things only get harder, as those ten conserved quantities are all we get. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we will spend so much of our time and efforts on the two-body system: it is literally the only one that can be explicitly solved for all time.  It is the only one where we are not forced to turn to numerical integration to get at the trajectories of the system.  However, this effort is not misplaced. Despite its apparent simplicity, and the basic fact that literally *nothing* in the universe is a true two-body system, lots and lots of things behave like collections of slightly perturbed two-body orbits (the solar system included).  So, it is not that we don't tackle the N-body problem because it's just too hard (it is, but we will anyway, promise).  We pause and make base camp at the two-body problem because the lessons it has to teach us will serve us well as start our ascent away from maximal superintegrability. "
