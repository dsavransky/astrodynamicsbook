    "\n",
    "Funny we should mention forces corresponding to zero moments.  Well, not funny, so much as incredibly convenient.  These forces are collectively known as **central forces**.  Formally, a force $\\mf F_P$ is a central force if $\\mf r_{P/O} \\times \\mf F_P = 0$ where $O$ is an inertially non-accelerating point and $\\mf r_{P/O} \\ne 0$. This definition has two corollaries:\n",
    "1. Particles experiencing only central forces have conserved angular momentum\n",
    "2. Since the angular momentum vector does not change in time, it represents a fixed direction in inertial space.  As both position and velocity are orthogonal to the angular momentum vector, all motion in a central force problem must take place in the plane orthogonal to the angular momentum vector.\n",

Therefore, in a central force problem, for all time, both position and velocity are constrained for all time to a 2D subspace (a plane) of the full 3D space.\n",

So, let's make things a little bit less general, and assume that $f(r) \\propto -r^{-2}$.  This now describes an inverse-square law, and physics is chock-full of these, so this is probably not a bad direction to go in.  What does this buy us?  Now we have:\n",
    "$$\\fddt{I}\\left(\\leftexp{\\mc I}{\\mf p_{P/O}} \\times \\leftexp{\\mc I}{\\mf h_{P/O}}\\right) = \\kappa m \\fddt{I}\\left(\\frac{\\mf r_{P/O}}{\\Vert\\mf r_{P/O}\\Vert}\\right) $$\n",
    "where $\\kappa$ is some constant of proportionality in our $f(r)$ expression.  And now, we have to exact differentials on either side of an equals sign, which means we must integrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "   No, really, we must.  Anytime you see a derivative equal to another derivative in the same variable, you just have to integrate.  There's probably a law about it, somewhere.\n",
    "    </div>"

    "where $\\mf c$ is the constant of integration.  Since we have established that differentiation of vectors works in much the same way as differentiation of scalars (except for the frame-dependent behavior), the same must be true of integration (anti-differentiation) of vectors.  Anytime you evaluate an indefinite integral, you must introduce a constant of integration.  In the case where you're integrating a vector expression, the constant must be a vector.\n",

    "This vector is known as the **Laplace-Runge-Lenz** vector (or LRL vector) and pops up quite a bit in a fairly surprisingly broad cross section of physics. Our use of it will be limited to classical central force problems, but don't be surprised if you see it pop up in contexts of special relativity and quantum mechanics.\n",

    "While the vector can be defined for *any* central force, it is only conserved for inverse square forces (i.e., $f(r) = -\\kappa r^{-2}$). The really cool thing about this vector is that it tells you the exact shape of the trajectory of the system (the solution to the system's equations of motion).  Here's how:  let $\\theta$ be the angle between $\\mf c$ and $\\mf r_{P/O}$.  Then:\n",

This leads to three possible curves: ellipses (including circles), parabolae, and hyperbolae.  \n",
