    "# Newtonian Gravity \n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to introduce a new bit of physics, and add a fourth law to the three we've been using so far.  This is Newton's Law of Gravity, sometimes called Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. Once again, it is incredibly important to understand that it is a *law*, and postulates specific behavior that closely matches what we observe in the physical universe, most of the time, and under most conditions.  Modern physics now provides us with a better understanding of gravity, via Einstein's general theory of relativity, but it turns out that Newton's law works amazingly well in the vast majority of cases, and can almost *always* be used to get a very good first approximation for the dynamics of gravitational systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "    The use of <i>better</i> to describe general relativity is not a value judgment. It is merely shorthand for 'makes predictions that more closely agree with observed phenomena over a broader range of conditions'. We also know relativity to be incomplete, as it does not (yet) play nicely with quantum mechanics.  The theory of gravity will keep being developed as new discoveries are made and new theories proposed.  Newton's law of gravity, however, is immutable, and will remain the same forever.\n",

    "    Another aside: you will frequently hear (usually from physics majors) statements along the lines of: \"gravity is not a force.\"  This is honestly a bit of useless pedantry.  Yes, general relativity describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime due to uneven distribution of masses.  However, remember that we never actually defined what a force <i>is</i>.  Forces are the things that accelerate masses.  Gravity, in whatever flavor you happen to prefer, causes masses to move in particular ways, and apparently accelerate from the vantage point of an external observer.  Hence, insisting that gravity isn't a force is a bit silly.\n",

This system is incredibly important as it is the *only* gravitational system with a complete, closed-form, analytic solution.  All other gravitational systems require numerical integration in order to accurately predict the trajectories of constituent masses.
