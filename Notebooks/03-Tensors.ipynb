    "# Tensors and Outer Products\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that we started our [vector products discussion](#Vector-Products) by stating that we were going to be introducing three different vector products, but we ended up only discussing two.  That's because the third type of vector product requires us to first introduce the concept of **tensors**. Unlike our foray into the fabulous world of vectors, tensors are not directly motivated by Newton's laws.  However, as we continue working our way on a firm mathematical description of these laws, and the exploration of their caveats and implications, we will find tensor formalism enormously helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors can be thought of as a generalization of vectors that allow us to encode multilinear relationships between elements of vector spaces.  The core new concept that we need to add to our toolkit when it comes to tensors is **tensor rank**. The tensor rank (or order) describes the dimensionality of the array of scalars needed to describe the components of a tensor in some basis (reference frame).  So, a rank-0 tensor is a scalar.  A rank-1 tensor is a vector, whose components in some frame are encoded as a 1-D array (or column matrix). A rank-2 tensor, sometimes called a **dyadic**, has components that can be encoded as a 2-D array (or matrix). For our purposes, we will primarily be dealing with rank-2 tensors associated with the Euclidean vector space, with components encoded as 3x3 matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "    In various contexts, what we're calling rank here may be referred to as <b>order</b> or <b>dimensionality</b>, with order being the preferred nomenclature in many texts.  We reserve 'dimensionality' to describe the dimension of the associated vector space (almost always $\\mb R^3$ for us).  Some people insist that 'order' should always be used instead of 'rank' because matrix rank has a very specific (and different) definition in linear algebra (the number of linearly independent rows/columns in the matrix), but tensors are <i>not</i> matrices, and so we are comfortable using 'rank' in this context. Plus, it's fun to piss off mathematicians.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we get at these tensors? The answer turns out to be: indirectly.  We're going to posit a basis for the tensors based on the **outer product** (or tensor product) operator ($\\otimes$), and develop our understanding of these two concepts jointly.\n",

    "A rank-2 tensor (dyadic) $\\mb T$ can be defined as the outer product of two vectors $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$, such that: $\\mb T \\triangleq \\mf a\\otimes \\mf b$.  Recall that $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$ can be expressed as weighted sums of basis elements:\n",

    "The dot product that we developed for geometric vectors can be applied equivalently to tensors, save that a dot product between a tensor and a vector will not return a scalar.  Remember that the dot product is an inner product, which means that it is rank-reducing. The dot product between two vectors (rank-1 tensors) produces a scalar. The dot product between a dyadic and a vector produces another vector. So, in the same way that we previously found that $a_i = \\mf a \\cdot \\bhat e_i$ and   $b_i = \\mf b \\cdot \\bhat e_i$ (for the $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$ definitions given above), we can equivalently write:\n",
