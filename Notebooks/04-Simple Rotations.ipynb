    "# Simple Rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "We've loaded up on a *lot* of mathematical formalism, so let's try to bring ourselves back (slightly) to the physical realm, and think about how all of this is going to help us interpret the physics encoded by Newton's laws.  We've established that these laws encode vector quantities, but also that they deal with *changes* in those quantities (remember: the second law is about \"the alteration of motion\").  We know from a mathematical standpoint that the scalar multiplication operator allows us to change the magnitude of a vector without changing its direction.  There is a ready, intuitive, interpretation for what is happening here - we are scaling the size of our vector, either moving the points the vector joins in space further apart or closer together.  However, what can we say about the change in a vector's direction?  Let's try to look at the geometry of a rotation operation: changing the direction of a vector in space without altering its magnitude.  We will call this type of motion a **simple rotation**.\n",

    "Consider the setup in the  <a href=\"#fig:simprot1\" >figure</a>, above. We have two vectors $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$, of equal magnitude, whose projections onto the shaded plane are separated by an angle $\\theta$.  The direction $\\bhat{n}$ is orthogonal to the plane, and is special, because it is the *only* direction in which the components of $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$ are equal.  That is, we are positing that there exists a unit vector $\\bhat n$ such that $\\bhat n \\cdot \\mf b \\equiv \\bhat n \\cdot \\mf a$, and further that this vector is unique for the assumed geometry. $\\bhat{n}$ is known as the **axis of rotation** while $\\theta$ is the **angle of rotation** and jointly, they form the **axis-angle** representation of a simple rotation.\n",

    "We would like to describe the relationship between the $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$ vectors, which will hopefully allow us to derive a rotation operator that we can apply in general.   We start by decomposing the two vectors into components in the $\\bhat n$ direction and the plane orthogonal to $\\bhat n$, as shown in the <a href=\"#fig:simprot1\" >figure</a>.  The projection of each vector into the $\\bhat{n}$ direction is given by $(\\mf a \\cdot \\bhat{n})\\bhat{n}$ and $(\\mf b \\cdot \\bhat{n})\\bhat{n}$.  Remember that we have specifically selected $\\bhat{n}$ such that these two quantities are identical. The remainder of each vector (the parts that lie in the shaded plane) can be found by subtracting these projections from the original vector.   Thus, what we are doing is writing:\n",

    "where in the final line, we have applied our assumption that $(\\mf a \\cdot \\bhat{n})\\bhat{n} \\equiv (\\mf b \\cdot \\bhat{n})\\bhat{n}$.  Since nothing of interest is happening in the $\\bhat{n}$ direction, let's ignore it for now and just focus on the plane orthogonal to $\\bhat{n}$:\n",

The horizontal line is the component of the original $\\mf a$ vector that lies in the plane orthogonal to $\\bhat{n}$.  The diagonal line is the component of the original $\\mf b$ vector that lies in this plane.  By our system definition, the angle between these two vectors is $\\theta$.  Finally, we are going to add a new thing (the vertical line) to represent the direction (still in the same plane) that is orthogonal to the $\\mf a$ component in the plane.  We do so by taking advantage of the properties of cross products, and crossing the $\\mf a$ in-plane component with $\\bhat{n}$, which we know to be orthogonal to the plane.\n",

    "We're going to take advantage of the fact that both scalar multiplication and the dot product are commutative, so every $(\\mf a \\cdot \\bhat{n})\\bhat{n}$ term is equivalent to $\\bhat{n}(\\bhat{n}\\cdot \\mf a)$, and look more closely at the final term multiplying $\\sin\\theta$.  Remember that the cross product is distributive over vector addition, so we can write: \n",
    "$$\\bhat{n} \\times \\left(\\mf a - \\bhat{n}(\\bhat{n}\\cdot \\mf a)\\right) = \\bhat{n} \\times \\mf a  - \\bhat{n} \\times \\bhat{n}(\\bhat{n}\\cdot \\mf a) =  \\bhat{n} \\times \\mf a  $$\n",

The question is, can we factor out the $\\mf a$ instances on the right-hand side?  Turns out, yes, we absolutely can, again leveraging the fact that the dot product is distributive over every relevant operator here.  Here's how it goes:\n",

    "\n",
    "The first substitution is definitional - the identity element $\\mb U$, when dotted with any vector returns the same vector.  The second substitution stems from our previous exploration of vector-dyadic dot products, and we have already verified an expression of this exact form.  Finally, the third substitution relates to our previous discussion on how any vector cross product can be represented by a dyadic-vector dot product via the introduction of the dyadic whose components are the cross-product equivalent matrix.  Basic message: we did the hard work already, and are now reaping the fruits of that labor. \n",
    "\n",
    "And what is it, exactly, that we are reaping here?  Well, we can now go ahead and factor out that $\\cdot \\mf a$ term from all three parts of the right-hand side of our equation, to find the **Rodrigues equation** (or Rodrigues's rotation formula), named after French banker, mathematician, social crusader, and coiner of the term avant-garde (in its modern artistic usage), Olinde Rodrigues: \n",

    "So what have we learned here? The whole expression on the right-hand side of the Rodrigues equation being dotted with $\\mf a$ is itself a dyadic (every individual term is a dyadic, and the sum of dyadics is a dyadic).  We can make it explicit by defining it:\n",
    "$$\\mb R \\triangleq \\cos\\theta \\mb U  +  (1 - \\cos\\theta)\\bhat{n}\\otimes\\bhat{n} + \\sin\\theta \\mbhat n_\\times$$\n",
    "which means that $\\mf b = \\mb R \\cdot \\mf a$.  This is exactly what we wanted.  There exists a single operator, which we will call the **rotation dyadic** ($\\mb R$), which is defined solely in terms of the axis and angle of a rotation, that exactly transforms a vector $\\mf a$ into a vector $\\mf b$, rotated about axis $\\bhat{n}$ by a counter-clockwise angle $\\theta$, while preserving the vector's magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to overstate the importance of what we have just found.  The existence of the rotation dyadic is fundamentally key to essentially all of our future explorations, but, on its own, it has not quite yet demonstrated its full utility.  To see that, we're going to have to introduce some reference frames and look at the component representation of this tensor quantity."

    "Yikes! Well, that looks awful.  Perhaps it simplifies down a bit?  Let's consider just the first term of the first row of the resulting matrix (as all of them have the same basic form): $(\\mathbf{\\hat{a}}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}_1) (\\mathbf{r}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}_1)$.  This is known as a **multilinear form**, and is, due to the nature of the dot product, fully linear in each of the four arguments in the two dot products.  The upshot of this is that we can regroup this statement in pretty much any way that preserves the final scalar output.  For example, we can write:\n",
    "$$(\\mathbf{\\hat{a}}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}_1) (\\mathbf{r}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}_1) \\equiv \\bhat a_1 \\cdot \\left((\\bhat b_1 \\cdot \\mf r)\\bhat b_1\\right)$$\n",

Notice that the summation in that expression is exactly equal to $\\mf r$ itself.  Applying the same reasoning to the full matrix, we find:\n",

    "Wow.  Just...wow.  This is so cool, in fact, that it merits a renaming of our DCM.

    "The rotation dyadic $\\mb R$ encodes a counter-clockwise rotation (by angle $\\theta$ about rotation axis $\\bhat{n}$) rotating a frame $\\mc A$ into a frame $\\mc B$.

    "This is incredibly powerful.  We have suddenly gained the ability to easily translate the components of any vector between any pair of frames!  The only thing here that may be hard to wrap your mind around is the apparent disconnect in how we talked about the rotation dyadic and the DCM.  The first is described as encoding a rotation from $\\mc A$ to $\\mc B$, while the second is described as transforming vector components from $\\mc B$ to $\\mc A$.  In fact, there is no contradiction here - we are merely using these two mathematical tools in two different ways.  The dyadic (and its matrix representation, the DCM) do encode a rotation of vectors - that is, they take a vector in $\\mc A$ and rotate it into the equivalent vector in $\\mc B$. The output of this operation is a new vector, with the same magnitude as the original, but a new orientation given by the rotation. The use of the DCM to transform vector components deals with the *same* vector and only transforms its component representation. We will most often be using DCMs in this latter fashion (to transform vector components), and this informs our notation for them.  The superscripts on the DCM should be read from right to left ($\\framerot{A}{B}$ transforms from $\\mc B$ to $\\mc A$) and the DCM is expected to be right-multiplied by the component matrix in the frame of the right superscript."
