    "# Simple Rotations\n",

    "We've loaded up on a *lot* of mathematical formalism, so let's try to bring ourselves back (slightly) to the physical realm, and think about how all of this is going to help us interpret the physics encoded by Newton's laws.  We've established that these laws encode vector quantities, but also that they deal with *changes* in those quantities (remember: the second law is about \"the alteration of motion\").  We know from a mathematical standpoint that the scalar multiplication operator allows us to change the magnitude of a vector without changing its direction.  There is a ready, intuitive, interpretation for what is happening here - we are scaling the size of our vector, either moving the points the vector joins in space further apart or closer together.  However, what can we say about the change in a vector's direction?  Let's try to look at the geometry of a rotation operation: changing the direction of a vector in space without altering its magnitude.  We will call this type of motion a **simple rotation**.\n",

We have two vectors $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$, of equal magnitude, whose projections onto the shaded plane are separated by an angle $\\theta$.  The direction $\\bhat{n}$ is orthogonal to the plane, and is special, because it is the *only* direction in which the components of $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$ are equal.  That is, we are positing that there exists a unit vector $\\bhat n$ such that $\\bhat n \\cdot \\mf b \\equiv \\bhat n \\cdot \\mf a$, and further that this vector is unique for the assumed geometry. $\\bhat{n}$ is known as the **axis of rotation** (sometimes called the Euler axis)while $\\theta$ is the **angle of rotation** and jointly, they form the **axis-angle** representation of a simple rotation.\n",

We start by decomposing the two vectors into components in the $\\bhat n$ direction and the plane orthogonal to $\\bhat n$, as shown in the <a href=\"#fig:simprot1\" >figure</a>.  The projection of each vector into the $\\bhat{n}$ direction is given by $(\\mf a \\cdot \\bhat{n})\\bhat{n}$ and $(\\mf b \\cdot \\bhat{n})\\bhat{n}$.  Remember that we have specifically selected $\\bhat{n}$ such that these two quantities are identical. The remainder of each vector (the parts that lie in the shaded plane) can be found by subtracting these projections from the original vector.   Thus, what we are doing is writing:\n",

The diagonal line is the component of the original $\\mf b$ vector that lies in this plane.  By our system definition, the angle between these two vectors is $\\theta$.  Finally, we are going to add a new thing (the vertical line) to represent the direction (still in the same plane) that is orthogonal to the $\\mf a$ component in the plane.

The question is, can we factor out the $\\mf a$ instances on the right-hand side?

Finally, the third substitution relates to our previous discussion on how any vector cross product can be represented by a dyadic-vector dot product via the introduction of the dyadic whose components are the cross-product equivalent matrix.  Basic message: we did the hard work already, and are now reaping the fruits of that labor. \n",
    "\n",
    "And what is it, exactly, that we are reaping here?  Well, we can now go ahead and factor out that $\\cdot \\mf a$ term from all three parts of the right-hand side of our equation, to find the **Rodrigues equation** (or Rodrigues's rotation formula), named after French banker, mathematician, social crusader, and coiner of the term avant-garde (in its modern artistic usage), Olinde Rodrigues: \n",

    "$$\\mb R \\triangleq \\cos\\theta \\mb U  +  (1 - \\cos\\theta)\\bhat{n}\\otimes\\bhat{n} + \\sin\\theta \\mbhat n_\\times$$\n",

    "It is difficult to overstate the importance of what we have just found.  The existence of the rotation dyadic is fundamentally key to essentially all of our future explorations, but, on its own, it has not quite yet demonstrated its full utility.

    "Yikes! Well, that looks awful.  Perhaps it simplifies down a bit?  Let's consider just the first term of the first row of the resulting matrix (as all of them have the same basic form): $(\\mathbf{\\hat{a}}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}_1) (\\mathbf{r}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}_1)$.  This is known as a **multilinear form**, and is, due to the nature of the dot product, fully linear in each of the four arguments in the two dot products.  The upshot of this is that we can regroup this statement in pretty much any way that preserves the final scalar output.  For example, we can write:\n",
    "$$(\\mathbf{\\hat{a}}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}_1) (\\mathbf{r}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}_1) \\equiv \\bhat a_1 \\cdot \\left((\\bhat b_1 \\cdot \\mf r)\\bhat b_1\\right)$$\n",

Notice that the summation in that expression is exactly equal to $\\mf r$ itself.  Applying the same reasoning to the full matrix, we find:\n",

    "Wow.  Just...wow.  This is so cool, in fact, that it merits a renaming of our DCM.

    "The rotation dyadic $\\mb R$ encodes a counter-clockwise rotation (by angle $\\theta$ about rotation axis $\\bhat{n}$) rotating a frame $\\mc A$ into a frame $\\mc B$.

    "This is incredibly powerful.  We have suddenly gained the ability to easily translate the components of any vector between any pair of frames!  The only thing here that may be hard to wrap your mind around is the apparent disconnect in how we talked about the rotation dyadic and the DCM.  The first is described as encoding a rotation from $\\mc A$ to $\\mc B$, while the second is described as transforming vector components from $\\mc B$ to $\\mc A$.  In fact, there is no contradiction here - we are merely using these two mathematical tools in two different ways.  The dyadic (and its matrix representation, the DCM) do encode a rotation of vectors - that is, they take a vector in $\\mc A$ and rotate it into the equivalent vector in $\\mc B$. The output of this operation is a new vector, with the same magnitude as the original, but a new orientation given by the rotation. The use of the DCM to transform vector components deals with the *same* vector and only transforms its component representation. We will most often be using DCMs in this latter fashion (to transform vector components), and this informs our notation for them.  The superscripts on the DCM should be read from right to left ($\\framerot{A}{B}$ transforms from $\\mc B$ to $\\mc A$) and the DCM is expected to be right-multiplied by the component matrix in the frame of the right superscript.\n",

    "## Matrix Form of the Rodrigues Equation\n",
    "Now that we have seen the incredible utility of DCMs, let's provide ourselves with an easier way of computing them.  Remember: every vector/dyadic operation can be expressed as a linear algebraic operation on the components of the vectors/dyadics in some reference frame.  The Rodrigues equation is no exception:\n",

    "A few observations about this equation are in order: Recall that the identity dyadic ($\\mf U$) is equivalent to the identity matrix ($I$) in any frame.  We do not state an exact dimensionality for $I$, but it should be understood to be the 3x3 identity matrix.  Similarly, while the equation explicitly uses the components of $\\bhat{n}$ in the $\\mc A$ frame, remember that $\\bhat{n}$ has *exactly the same components in both* $\\mc{A}$ *and* $\\mc{B}$. This means that $\\mb R$ has exactly the same component representation in both frames, which makes sense, as it is purely a function of $\\bhat{n}$ and $\\theta$, the latter of which is a scalar and frame independent.\n",

    "At first blush, that looks absolutely ghastly, but upon further inspection...well, it still looks pretty gross.  But there are some notable features here.  In particular, pay attention to the fact that the diagonal elements are qualitatively different from the off-diagonal ones.  The diagonal is solely a function of the squares of the measure numbers of $\\bhat{n}$ and $\\cos\\theta$, while the off-diagonal terms are functions of both $\\cos\\theta$ and $\\sin\\theta$ as well as products of pairs of $\\bhat{n}$ components.   Finally, don't forget that $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are not mutually independent.  They represent components of a unit vector, which means that their magnitude must be unity:\n",

In particular: the range of both sine and cosine is [-1, 1], however, in taking the square root of $1 - \\cos^2(\\theta)$, we must pick just one value, and, by default, we typially pick the positive value, meaning that the right-hand side of the equation we just stated represents $\\sin(\\theta)$ is only in the range of [0,1].  Is this a problem?  In this case, not really. By guaranteeing that $\\sin(\\theta)$ is positive, we are effectively allowing for the sign on $\\bhat{n}$ to flip as needed to properly encode the rotation.  That is, is you start with a rotation of more than $\\pi$ radians about $\\bhat{n}$, generate the equivalent DCM, and then use the procedure above to compute the axis and angle of the rotation from the DCM, you will find an angle of $2\\pi$ minus your original angle, and an axis of $-\\bhat{n}$.

    "# Inverse Rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's back up a bit and note that $[\\mf r]_\\mc A = \\framerot{A}{B} [\\mf r]_\\mc B$ is a pure statement of linear algebra.  All three components of the equation ($\\framerot{A}{B}, [\\mf r]_\\mc A$, and $[\\mf r]_\\mc B$) are matrices, and are operated upon via matrix multiplication.  As such, we should be able to invert the operation by left-multiplying (remember, matrix multiplication is *not* commutative) by the inverse of $\\framerot{A}{B}$, like so:\n",
    "$$[\\mf r]_\\mc B = \\left(\\framerot{A}{B}\\right)^{-1}[\\mf r]_\\mc A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible (although tedious) to find the inverse of a 3x3 matrix, in this case, there's an easier option: this inverse matrix ($\\left(\\framerot{A}{B}\\right)^{-1}$) must be related to the dyadic encoding of the rotation of $\\mf b$ into $\\mf a$.  At this point, we could potentially go all the way back to the <a href=\"#fig:simprot1\" >figure</a> defining our $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$ vectors, and then re-derive a version of the Rodrigues equation that gives us the dyadic $\\mb R^T$ such that $\\mf a = \\mb R^T \\cdot \\mf b$.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hope you had fun on that little journey there. But you have to ask yourself: \"was that trip really necessary?\"  What if, instead, we used our physical understanding of what the rotation dyadic is doing in order to derive its inverse?  The rotation dyadic $\\mb R$, that we so carefully derived the exact form of, above, it rotating a vector $\\mf a$ about an axis $\\bhat{n}$ by an angle $\\theta$ in order to generate a vector $\\mf b$, whose magnitude is the same as that of $\\mf a$ but whose direction is now changed due to the rotation.  What is the inverse of this process?  Well, it's rotating vector $\\mf b$ about axis $\\bhat{n}$ by an angle $-\\theta$ (remember our right-handed, counter-clockwise positive convention) to get back to vector $\\mf a$.  So, in essence, the only difference between $\\mb R$ and its inverse operator (which we'll call, for absolutely no particular reason whatsoever) $\\mb R^T$ is the sign of the rotation angle. What happens to the Rodrigues equation if the sign of $\\theta$ is flipped?  Well, cosine is an even function, meaning that it doesn't care about the sign of its argument, while sine is an odd function, meaning that $\\sin(-\\theta) \\equiv -\\sin(\\theta)$.  So it appears that only one term out of the whole Rodrigues equation changes when the sign of $\\theta$ changes.  \n",

    "Ok. So it looks like DCMs are orthonormal, which instantly opens up a whole slew of cool properties, chief among them that $C^TC = CC^T = I$ for orthonormal matrix $C$ (i.e., every orthonormal matrix commutes with its transpose, and the product with its transpose yields the identity matrix).  This directly leads to the observation that $C^T \\equiv C^{-1}$.  Finally, in general, an orthonormal matrix has a determinant of positive or negative 1.  SO(3) only contains the subgroup of orthonormal matrices whose determinant is positive 1. "

    "# Basis Vector DCMs\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an incredibly important class of DCMs that we will be returning to again and again.  These are the matrices representing rotations where the axis of rotation is one of the unit vectors defining the reference frame.  Note that we didn't specify which reference frame, initial or final (what we've been calling $\\mc A$ and $\\mc B$).  That's because the axis of rotation is the only direction that's the same between the two frames.  So, these are the DCMs encoding rotations between frames that share one of their unit vectors. Again defining our frames as $\\mc A = (\\bhat{a}_1, \\bhat{a}_2, \\bhat{a}_3)$ and $\\mc B = (\\bhat{b}_1, \\bhat{b}_2, \\bhat{b}_3)$, respectively, we can draw the three cases where $\\mc B$ is a counterclockwise $\\theta$ rotation about $\\bhat{a}_1$ or $\\bhat{a}_2$ or $\\bhat{a}_3$.  In each of these cases, there will be on shared unit vector between the two frames: $\\bhat{b}_1 \\equiv \\bhat{a}_1$, $\\bhat{b}_2 \\equiv \\bhat{a}_2$, or $\\bhat{b}_3 \\equiv \\bhat{a}_3$, respectively:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that while $\\theta$ is drawn between only one pair of unit vectors in each image, the same angle separates the other pair - for example, when rotating about $\\bhat{a}_1 \\equiv \\bhat{b}_1$ the angle between $\\bhat{a}_2$ and $\\bhat{b}_2$ is the same as the angle between  $\\bhat{a}_3$ and $\\bhat{b}_3$. In each case, the shaded region represents the $\\bhat{a}_1 - \\bhat{a}_2$ plane (equivalently the $\\bhat{b}_1 - \\bhat{b}_2$ plane.  Remember that in each case, the rotation shows in counter-clockwise when viewed looking *down* the rotation axis (which is why the $\\bhat{a}_2 \\equiv \\bhat{b}_2$ rotation may look qualitatively different from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see if we can use our previously developed formalism to find the DCMs associated with each of these.  In each case, we're going to be finding the $\\framerot{B}{A}$ DCM:"

This always corresponds to the axis of rotation (because components along this axis are not transformed by the rotation). The remainder of each matrix is a block of two cosine and two sine terms, with the cosines on the diagonal and sines off diagonal, with a single negative value on one of the signs.

    "# Dyadic Change of Basis\n",

    "We have now established that the DCM between two frames can be used to convert the components of a vector expressed in one frame to components of the vector in the other via matrix multiplication, but how about dyadics?  Recall that we can represent $\\mb T$ as an outer product of two vectors, such that $\\mb T = \\mf a \\otimes \\mf b$. In this case, the component representation of $\\mb T$ with respect to some frame $\\mc A$ would be  $[\\mf a]_\\mc A [\\mf b]_\\mc A^T$.  We can transform each of $\\mf a$ and $\\mf b$ to $\\mc B$ frame components via the DCM $\\framerot{B}{A}$, and so the $\\mc B$ frame representation of $\\mb T$ would be:\n",
    "$$ \\left[\\mb T\\right]_\\mc B = \\framerot{B}{A}[\\mf a]_\\mc A \\left(\\framerot{B}{A} [\\mf b]_\\mc A\\right)^T = \\framerot{B}{A}[\\mf a]_\\mc A[\\mf b]_\\mc A^T\\framerot{A}{B} = \\framerot{B}{A}\\left[\\mb T\\right]_\\mc A \\framerot{A}{B} $$\n",
    "where we have used the linear algebraic identity that the transpose of the product of matrices $A$ and $B$ is: $(AB)^T = B^TA^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the frame representations of dyadics can be transformed via the exact same DCMs as vectors, save that we need to apply the DCM twice - left multiplying by the DCM and right multiplying by its transpose."
