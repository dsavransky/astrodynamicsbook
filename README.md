More description coming as soon as I figure out what this is going to be.  

For now, click the Binder badge above this line and wait a few minutes.  Once JupyterLab launches, click on the file browser (top icon in the left-hand panel) and select a notebook (I'd recommend starting from 01-Introduction.ipynb).  Give it a few seconds to render and then tell me what you think.
